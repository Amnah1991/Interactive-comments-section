# Interactive-comments-section
Frontend Mentor Challenge 


# Brief
The challenge is to build out  interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- using localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
